        <h1>Zero-waste lectures</h1>
        <p>
            In addition to help people reduce waste, we are also actively involved in sustainability, zero-waste,
            minimalism, waste and its prevention, ecology, the environment and its protection. As part of
            <span class="bold">raising awareness</span> in this topics, we are also part of various events, discussions,
            performances, exhibitions. <span class="bold">At the same time, we give lectures to companies, schools and
                other
                organizations</span> that are interested in opening these topics.
        </p>
        <img class="hero-img" src="assets/images/vector/R5.png" alt="">

        <h1>What to expect</h1>
        <p> Within these lectures, we will introduce people to the issues of a specific topic, the current state in the
            world and in Slovakia, and we will bring <span class="bold">useful tips applicable to the household and the
                work environment.</span> The lecture can be a separate or it can be a <span class="bold">series of
                lectures</span> that follow each other. We are coming up with the latest new <span class="bold">EkoKvíz
                format!</span> </p>
        <p> <span class="bold">The duration is 50 minutes</span> + discussion as standard, but we are flexible and will
            adapt to your requirements. You can choose from several topics, or <span class="bold">we will tailor the
                lecture to your wishes,</span> or we can fit a specific topic to the environment of your company, school
            and its functioning.
        <p>Are you not indifferent to the ecological impact of your company or school? Do you think that more could be
            done?</p>

            <p>
                We chose BEZOBALiS as a partner for our project Adient Eco-challenge 2019. As part of the project, we
                organized lectures on various topics related to environmental protection on a monthly basis in
                cooperation with BEZOBALiS. I would very much like to emphasize their professionalism, flexibility and
                high expertise. The lectures have always been very interesting and stimulating, and based on them, we
                have made a number of changes not only in the company, but also in our households, which we have shown
                that we really care about our environment.
