        <h1>Zero-waste lectures</h1>
        <p>
            In addition to help people reduce waste, we are also actively involved in sustainability, zero-waste,
            minimalism, waste and its prevention, ecology, the environment and its protection. As part of raising
            awareness in this topics, we are also part of various events, discussions, performances, exhibitions. At the
            same time, we give lectures to companies, schools and other organizations that are interested in opening
            these topics.
        </p>

        <h1>What to expect</h1>
        <p>
            Within these lectures, we will introduce people to the issues of a specific topic, the current state in the
            world and in Slovakia, and we will bring useful tips applicable to the household and the work environment.
            The lecture can be a separate or it can be a series of lectures that follow each other. We are coming up
            with the latest new EkoKvíz format!
        </p>
        <p>
            The duration is 50 minutes + discussion as standard, but we are flexible and will adapt to your
            requirements.
            You can choose from several topics, or we will tailor the lecture to your wishes, or we can fit a specific
            topic to the environment of your company, school and its functioning.
            <br>
            Are you not indifferent to the ecological impact of your company or school? Do you think that more could be
            done?

            <p>
                We chose BEZOBALiS as a partner for our project Adient Eco-challenge 2019. As part of the project, we
                organized lectures on various topics related to environmental protection on a monthly basis in
                cooperation with BEZOBALiS. I would very much like to emphasize their professionalism, flexibility and
                high expertise. The lectures have always been very interesting and stimulating, and based on them, we
                have made a number of changes not only in the company, but also in our households, which we have shown
                that we really care about our environment.
